UrbanBEATS
==========

An exploratory model for strategic planning of urban water infrastructure

UrbanBEATS (Urban Biophysical Environments And Technologies Simulator) is an open source exploratory tool that can be used to test numerous planning scenarios of urban water infrastructure. This model integrates planning of the urban form with decentralised water management and water sensitive urban design, two philosophies that have gained momentum in recent decades. Although it is inherently technical, the purpose of such a model is to encourage participatory and interdisciplinary planning.

This repository houses the original VIBe2 Implementation of UrbanBEATS and first translation of the code into the DynaMind framework. Progressive development on the tool will then take place in a separate and new repository.

The model is built on the VIBe/DynaMind Framework
